            `This project is to design a system to automate certain project management aspects of software
            development at a medium size company. The company usually structures their projects in a standard fashion. This allows
            employees to record their time worked on the project (and get paid), allows customers to
            be billed for the work the company spends on the project, and allows the project manager
            to know how well the project is being run and to report to management. \n \n
            Key features: \n
            * Employees are allowed to submit their work hours via an online timesheet. \n 
            * Supervisor will be able to review/approve the submitted timesheet. \n 
            * Project Manager can create projects, allocate teammembers. \n 
            * Project Manager can view project progress reports. \n
